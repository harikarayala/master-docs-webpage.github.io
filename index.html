	<p>	These words by award-winning poet and long-time resident Luis Tubens seem particularly prescient as Pilsen residents call for an ordinance that would protect murals threatened by increasing development in their neighborhood. </p>

	<h3>History of Murals in Pilsen</h3>

	<p>	According to Tubens, the mural movement in Pilsen was pioneered in the 1960s by Mario Castillo to unify and educate Mexican-Americans about their heritage. Since then, countless other murals have sprung up in Pilsen and have become important symbols of the neighborhood’s identity. Tours are frequently organized by the Chicago History Museum and local artists to showcase them to nonresidents.</p>

	<h3>Developer Paints over Murals on Community Center</h3>

	<p>	So, when developer Andy Ahitow painted over iconic murals on the former Casa Aztlan community center in Pilsen, it sparked outcry from dozens of residents who gathered in a meeting this past Tuesday. The meeting, as the Chicagoist reports, was standing room only. Ahitow has since promised to recreate the murals but discussions continue amongst residents concerned about the future destruction of murals as neighborhood properties are increasingly being eyed by developers. Leading the discussions is the Pilsen Alliance, a social justice organization that is aimed at developing grassroots leadership in the community.</p>

	<h3>Pilsen Residents Call for an Ordinance</h3>

	<p>	Yesterday, the Pilsen Alliance held a meeting with residents that was centered around “culture and the importance of the preservation of murals,” according to Byron Sigcho, director of the organization. The main takeaway from that meeting, according to Sigcho, was a shared agreement about the importance of establishing an ordinance to protect murals. “There are a lot of residents that care about this issue. We are currently working on organizing a mass march to call for an ordinance, educate the community, and put pressure on local elected officials to put money where their mouth is [sic].”</p>

	<p>	Sigcho points out that while local officials have voiced interest in preserving the murals, there has been little in the way of concrete actions. “They talk about the great things that they want to do but little gets done."</p>

	<p>	Sigcho and residents hope that the upcoming march would push officials to do more.</p>
